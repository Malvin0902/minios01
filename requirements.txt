# Virtual Memory System Simulator - Requirements

# Core Python libraries (usually included with Python installation)
# tkinter - GUI framework for the application interface
# No additional installation needed for tkinter as it comes with Python

# The application uses only Python standard library modules:
# - tkinter (GUI framework)
# - random (for random memory access simulation)
# - time (for timestamps and simulation timing)
# - threading (for background simulation)
# - collections (deque for FIFO queue implementation)
# - dataclasses (for Page and Frame data structures)
# - typing (for type hints)

# Python version requirement
# Python >= 3.6

# Note: This application is designed to work with Python's standard library only
# to ensure maximum compatibility and ease of deployment.

# For development and testing (optional):
# pytest>=6.0.0
# black>=21.0.0
# flake8>=3.8.0

# If you want to package the application (optional):
# pyinstaller>=4.0
# cx-Freeze>=6.0
