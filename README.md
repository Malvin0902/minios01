## üìã Usage Guide

### Basic Operations

1. **Create a Process**:
   - Enter Process ID and number of pages
   - Click "Create Process"

2. **Access Memory**:
   - Select a process and enter virtual address
   - Choose page replacement algorithm (FIFO, LRU, Clock)
   - Optionally mark as write operation
   - Click "Access Memory"

3. **Address Translation**:
   - Enter process ID and virtual address
   - Click "Translate Address" to see physical address mapping

4. **Automatic Simulation**:
   - Create one or more processes
   - Click "Start Simulation" for automated random memory accesses
   - Click "Stop Simulation" to halt

### Interface Components

#### Control Panel
- **Process Management**: Create and terminate processes
- **Memory Access**: Manual memory access with algorithm selection
- **Simulation Controls**: Start/stop automatic simulation and system reset

#### Display Areas
- **Physical Memory**: Visual representation of memory frames with process colors

- **Activity Log**: Chronological event history

### Example Workflow

1. Create Process 1 with 4 pages
2. Create Process 2 with 3 pages
3. Access virtual addresses (0, 4096, 8192, etc.)
4. Observe page faults and frame allocations
5. Compare different algorithm performances
6. Use "Compare Algorithms" for detailed analysis
